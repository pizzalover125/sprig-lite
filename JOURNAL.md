A couple of years ago, I got introduced to the attiny85 in an electronics class. I basically built this exact project on a breadboard. That was SUPER cool and was where I began my electronics journey. Ok so I began with the PCB. Schematic was super simple, as the attiny85 is super simple. Originally, I was thinking to have a CR2032 for a battery as it is super small and minimalist. Then I realized that I could make a game console fit on the back of 2 AA batteries. I also liked that because it would give me infinite battery life. So I went with that. I then made the PCB layout and routed everything super fast. It was super easy.

Today I made some minor refinements. First, I added PCB silkscreen art. I also decided to call this project "sprig-lite" and use their artowrk and stuff. Then, I decided to add an aditional button for the ability to play more games. For some reason changing the switch was super hard. KiCad just wouldn't work :cry:. Eventually, I got this one model to work. I also calculated that this device will literlly have 60-70 hours of battery life. I also made the BOM. This project, I'll use Amazon because AliExpress is just too unreliable. I also decided to ditch the 3D case because its too pointless for a device supposed to be minimal and I don't want to make it bigger. Here is the finished product:
